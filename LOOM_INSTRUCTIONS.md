## Sample Script

"Hi, I'm demonstrating MGNREGA LokDekho, a district dashboard designed specifically for low-literacy rural users in India.

[Homepage] The app starts with a simple welcome screen in Hindi, with large fonts and clear icons. Users can either detect their location automatically or manually select their district.

[District Selection] I'll select Agra district from Uttar Pradesh. The search is fast and uses our local database with cursor-based pagination.

[Dashboard] Here's the main dashboard showing four key metrics: registered households, person-days of work, total wages paid, and women's participation. Each card has large icons, big numbers, and audio explanations.

[Audio Demo] Let me click this audio button - it explains the metric in simple Hindi for users who may have difficulty reading.

[Technical] Behind the scenes, this runs on our own VPS with PostgreSQL database, Redis caching, and background workers that sync data nightly from government APIs. All list endpoints use cursor-based pagination as required.

[Accessibility] The entire interface is designed for accessibility - large touch targets, high contrast support, keyboard navigation, and works well on low-bandwidth mobile connections.

This demonstrates a production-ready application that meets all the technical requirements while being genuinely usable by the target audience of rural citizens checking their local MGNREGA performance."
